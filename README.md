## About

A simple program that utilizes OpenAI's API to get responses from their language models, this program is a work in progress and I will try to update it with features every once in a while. If you feel you can improve any of my code feel free to open a PR.

## Installation

Python 3.9 or above is recommended but older versions will probably work just fine.

You will need an API key to run this application. You can get one from [here](https://openai.com/login). 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mokeWe/openAI-pyqt
cd openAI-pyqt
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

Before you can run the program make sure your API key is in `token.txt`, it should start like this: `sk-...` 
Run the program:

```bash
python3 pyqt.py
```
  

## Documentation

OpenAI provides a very good guide in prompt engineering and basic function for
their large language models, it is called the [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook). There are also multiple examples within the repository that you try out yourself.

# openAI-pyqt
 Simple OpenAI API requester in python and PyQt5.

 If anything doesn't work, open an issue, and I'll try to help.

`cx.bat` is for freezing the python script, if you want to freeze the script to make it portable make sure cxFreeze is installed and run `cx.bat`

this entire thing also sucks ass
